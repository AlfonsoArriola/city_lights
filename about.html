             City Lights offers high quality cleaning and facilities maintenance services at amazingly affordable prices. We specialize in office cleaning and commercial building maintenance. Our cleaning professionals are among the very best.
           </p>
           <p>
             We are able to claim they are the best because they are all put through our rigorous training process. Our employees are expertly trained to put effort and love into their work and to take pride in their job, and they've proved over and over to do just that.
           </p>

             We are headquartered in the Soho neighborhood in lower Manhattan and focus on providing services to only a small part of New York City. 98% percent of our customers are in the Soho, Noho, Tribeca and Chelsea neighborhoods. Many other cleaning services will provide services anywhere in the five boroughs of N.Y.C; we do not. Unfortunately most cleaning companies are in the numbers business and focus on getting as many accounts as possible, using discount cleaning products, paying their employees partial hours per office and some not even paying their employees for travel time. They focus only on numbers. Actually their vision from the very beginning, is eventually losing your business! They often provide you with the least value for your money to maximize their profits for as long as possible. This type of business model leads to many unsatisfied customers. I have worked for many cleaning companies throughout my life and I have seen this first hand. I've received much advice from other cleaning company owners to not worry about my customers, worry about always getting new ones. I completely disagree with this business model. When I opened City Lights Maintenance my goal was to create a good old fashioned, honest to goodness service business. I strive for long term relationships with my customers, and it works. Many of our customers have been with us for over 10 years. Also the majority, if not all, of our business comes from recommendations. My other goal was to have a business that has happy employees. Our employees are treated with respect and dignity. Myself and the employees of City Lights are in business together, we are one. The company might not have an impressively high profit margin, but we sure do have happy customers and happy employees, which makes us a very solid company that will be around for a long time to come.
